Use make to get following files:-

basic.prep: It is a text file after preprocessing.
basic.cp: It is intermediate code after compilation but before assembly. It is also a text file.
basic.o: It is compiled and assembled file. It is binary file.It is not executable because it is not linked. Use objdump utility to view its contents.
basic.out: It is executable file. It is also a binary file. To view its contents use readelf utility.


Observation
1) Intermediate code basic.cp has no branch for NO. Compiler has optimised it.
2) basic.o lesser number of sections than basic.out. Extra sections are related to execution.
